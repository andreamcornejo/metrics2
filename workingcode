lags <- VARselect(dfts, lag.max=12) # BIC --> 2, HQ --> 2, AIC/FPE --> 4
print(lags)

There is no one single test or method to determine the lag order of bivariate models. Using VARselect, we see
The Schwrz Bayes info criteria (SC) yields 2, while Akaike AIC gives 4. However, for both of these, the difference
between order 2 and 4 is not much. In this context, we will move forward with lag order 2 for simplicity.
